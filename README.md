# Token Status List

A Java implementation of the [Token Status List specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list), which defines a mechanism for representing the status of 
tokens secured by JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) or CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE), such as JWT, 
SD-JWT VC, CBOR Web Token and ISO mdoc.
